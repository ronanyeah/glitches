# Node.js Server Glitches

Three [Glitches](https://glitch.com) demonstrating different approaches to writing a Node.js server with the bare minimum of package dependencies. This is intended to demonstrate:
- Static file serving
- Text response
- JSON response
- Cookie login/logout
- Non-200 status code response

Notes:
- All projects on Glitch can be 'remixed', i.e. forked, and live edited.
- Do not use the cookie code in production as they are all unsigned and are not marked as HttpOnly, so can be easily edited by the client.
